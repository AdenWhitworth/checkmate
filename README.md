# Checkmate

Welcome to the Checkmate project! This repository contains links to my personal projects related to the Checkmate application, which allows players to challenge friends to chess matches, chat during the game, and track their rankings. The project is split into two repositories: the **Frontend** and **Backend**.

## Checkmate Demo

The Checkmate application is live and can be accessed here: [Checkmate Demo](https://checkmateplay.com). You can explore all features of the game, including real-time gameplay, chat, and rankings.

### Test User Credentials

Try out the app using the following demo accounts:

- **Emails:** demo1@gmail.com & demo2@gmail.com
- **Password:** PortfolioDemo1!

>**Note**: You can even play against yourself by opening the application in two separate browser windows.

## Front-End: [Checkmate Front-End](https://github.com/AdenWhitworth/checkmate_Front-End)

The web-based user interface for the Checkmate application, built with React, designed for a seamless user experience. It handles all interactions with the game, including making moves, real-time chat, and ranking display.

## Back-End: [Checkmate Back-End](https://github.com/AdenWhitworth/checkmate_Back-End)

The Node.js backend API that controls active chess games, user authentication, in-game chat, and ranking systems. It ensures real-time gameplay and communication through WebSockets.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the development of dynamic and responsive web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better tooling and type safety during development.
- **HTML/JSX**: The foundational markup language used for structuring the components of the React application, ensuring semantic and accessible content.
- **CSS**: Styles the application with a modern aesthetic, allowing for flexible and maintainable design.
- **React Router**: A library that enables dynamic routing in the application, providing a seamless navigation experience for users.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: A popular React component library that implements Google's Material Design, providing pre-designed components for charts, gauges, and more, enhancing visual consistency.

- **React-chessboard.js**: A lightweight and flexible chessboard library designed for React, providing an intuitive interface for displaying and interacting with chess positions in your React applications.
- **Chess.js**: A JavaScript library that implements chess mechanics, enabling the creation of legal move generation, validation, and game state management in a chess application.
- **uuid.js**: A library used to generate unique identifiers (UUIDs), essential for creating distinct and secure references for users, games, and various entities in web applications.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Authentication**: Provides secure sign-in via various methods, including email/password, Google, etc.
  - **Firestore**: A NoSQL database optimized for real-time data storage and synchronization.
  - **Admin**: Firebase Admin SDK is used for server-side operations like managing users, securely accessing Firebase databases, and performing other privileged tasks such as setting up custom claims for user roles and managing user accounts programmatically.
